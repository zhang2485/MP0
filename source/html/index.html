	<p> I am a proud Student at U of I, when I was younger, one of my curiosities was how web development worked. I surfed through the internet looking through many fun and interesting things before noticing various sites create their web pages with an unique style. I quickly realized that web development is a complex, but popular topic in Computer Science, which is why I am excited to for this class. Aside from that, my interests and hobbies include listening to music and watching Netflix.
